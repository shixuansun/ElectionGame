Short Description:
1. Use recursive method to find all combinations of two parties and convert it to numberic number format (Quota, Quota, ... , Remainer).

2. Implement the payoff function of different profile combination.

3. Use burte force method to find all nash equilibria. The time complexity is the square of the number of partitions.

4. Plan to prune based on one heuristic method but existing some bugs. I would work on it.
